## Description

Python utility scripts for working with a Fortinet FortiGate FortiOS configuration file offline.

* policy_view - print policies offline from a configuration file (missing feature of the cli)

## Requirements

* Python >= 3

## Caveats for Policy script

* ANSI colors are specific to the BASH shell. Have not tested with others.
* Requires Python >= 3 to support the OrderedDict collection or installation of ordereddict (easy_install ordereddict)
* Primarily written with VDOMs enabled but will now skip certain logic if they are not.
* Can support IPv6 policies with a little editing: s/config firewall policy/config firewall policy6/
* Added new multi-select interface logic which is still new.
